  - Implement passwordless login / register

  - Implement user profile

  - Allow user to add "instrument" to his profile

  - Allow user to create new "panel"

  - Save user default I/O per panel ( persist to mongodb )

  - Implement basic UI using some/one of these libraries:

    - [controlkit](https://github.com/automat/controlkit.js)
    - [guify](https://github.com/colejd/guify)

  - Get a nice design for the website

# NOTES:

The code is a mess mainly because i created this repository to try out some
messy things together:

 - Meteor 1.7
 - WebMidi
 - NRPN Messages
 - Possibly ( but not sure yet ) React integration with Meteor 1.7
